## 2025-05-14 - [DuckDB WASM Optimization]
**Learning:** Establishing a persistent connection and caching file registrations significantly reduces overhead in DuckDB WASM. More importantly, moving filters into the innermost subquery on Parquet sources enables predicate pushdown, avoiding expensive operations like `regexp_extract` on unnecessary rows.
**Action:** Always favor predicate pushdown by filtering early in SQL queries, especially when dealing with Parquet files and complex transformations.
